# Project-4-Webscraping-and-API-s
Data Science Bootcamp @WBS Coding School


So far, the most sophisticated project i did.

Not coding-wise, but i love how everything comes together to a big thing here;
From webscraping to handling API´s into a SQL-Database, later to be automated in the cloud.
Like WTF - i did such thing within a few weeks into this bootcamp?!

U have to be kidding me!
- learned scraping with beautiful soup
- learned about API´s and how to "play with" aka request them
- went deeper into SQL (aswell as building a nice epic cheatsheet for future references as a little side project)
- did some almost pythonic alchemy to finally connect both languages
- handled the new to me AWS webservices "like a breeze" to automate that stuff

Sure, most of the stuff is pretty basic but i definetly know how to help myself if i have to dive deeper into the specific topics an am really having a blast so far.
Don´t expect much more than a rookie coding. But i can imagine what else i can do on those bases :)
Nothing super special, no cool "i-am-so-proud-i-invented-a-automating-function-in-pandas" thingie like in project 2,
but something that really shows off that i get the stuff done, even with little basic workarounds when needed.
Now having to start a article about it on medium i gonna link here, as the final presentation of the project.
