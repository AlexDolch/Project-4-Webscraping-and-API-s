## Fourth project of the Data Science Bootcamp @WBS Coding School
### Data Engineering: Webscraping, API and Cloud - Setting up a Data-Pipeline

---

So far, the most sophisticated project i did.

Not coding-wise, but i love how everything comes together to a big thing here;
From webscraping to handling API´s into a SQL-Database, later to be automated in the cloud.
Like WTF - i did such thing within a few weeks into this bootcamp?!
U have to be kidding me!

- **learned scraping with beautiful soup**
- **learned about API´s and how to "play with" aka request them**
- **went deeper into SQL (aswell as building a nice epic cheatsheet for future references as a little side project)**
- **did some "alchemy" to finally connect both languages**
- **handled the new to me AWS webservices "like a breeze" to automate**

Sure, most of the stuff is pretty basic but i definetly know how to help myself if i have to dive deeper into the specific topics an am really having a blast so far.
Don´t expect much more than a rookie coding. But i can imagine what else i can do on those bases :)
Nothing super special, no cool "i-am-so-proud-i-invented-a-automating-function-in-pandas" thingie like in project 2 (apart from my cheatsheet for sql maybe),
but something that really shows off that i get the stuff done, even with little basic workarounds when needed.

Now having to start a article about it on medium i gonna link here, as the final presentation of the project.
